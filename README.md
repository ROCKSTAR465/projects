![Streamlit](https://subtitles.streamlit.app/)

SubNXT is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to generate English subtitles for videos in real-time. Powered by OpenAI's Whisper model, it can transcribe videos in any language and provide accurate translations into English. Users can upload a video, generate subtitles in WebVTT format, preview the video with subtitles, and download the generated subtitle file.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Video Playback with Subtitles**: Watch your video directly within the app, complete with subtitles.
- üì• **Download Subtitles**: Download the generated subtitles as a `.vtt` file for future use.
